Welcome to *'At-Home Convenience'*, our innovative mobile application designed to revolutionize home service experiences for the residents of Ligao City. In this fast-paced world, we understand the value of time and convenience, and that's why we've created a streamlined online platform that connects you with various service providers catering to your home needs. From skilled professionals to local entities, our app bridges the gap between residents and service providers, all within the confines of Ligao City. As we embark on this journey together, we'd like to guide you through the essential aspects that ensure a seamless and satisfactory experience for both users and service providers.

1. **Title Requirement.**
It is a mandatory requirement for service providers to update the name on their profile account to reflect the name of their shop or establishment (for those of a professional nature). In the case of non-professional entities, it is expected that the name used in their profile accurately represents the specific type of work they are engaged in.

2. **Communication Guidelines.**
When conversing with service providers, users are expected to maintain a respectful tone and clearly outline the specific issue that requires attention to ensure the delivery of quality service.

3. **Payment Terms.**
Payment for services is made directly to the service provider on-site, and the application does not facilitate online payments. Users must clarify the service cost with the service provider beforehand.

4. **Service Quality.**
While the application strives to connect users with reputable service providers, the application is not responsible for the quality of services rendered by the service provider.

5. **Service Confirmation.**
Once the service provider is confirmed, users must ensure their availability at the scheduled time. Rescheduling and cancellations should be requested within the agreed-upon timeframe.

6. **Payment Disputes.**
Any conflicts related to payment, additional charges, or payment discrepancies between users and service providers are solely the responsibility of the involved parties. The application and admin are not liable for such disputes.

7. **Location Services Compliance.**
It is of utmost importance that users activate their device's location services accurately and exclusively within the designated service location. This meticulous adherence ensures that service providers are dispatched to the correct site for prompt assistance.

8. **Liability.**
Users and service providers acknowledge that the application is not liable for any damage, injury, or loss resulting from services provided or received through the platform.

9. **Rating System.**
Users are urged to offer candid ratings by selecting the appropriate number of stars. This practice enhances the overall service encounter and aids fellow users in making well-informed choices.

10. **Terms Updates.**
The application reserves the right to update its terms and conditions as necessary. Continued use of the app implies acceptance of the updated terms.

11. **Visual Submission Guidelines.**
Service providers must share images or proof of past work to build user confidence. Irrelevant visuals are not allowed. Users must use a clear photograph of themselves as their profile picture. Cartoon avatars or unrelated images are not allowed. Physical businesses should use a shop photo as their profile picture to enhance authenticity and trust within the community.

12. **Service Request Availability and Provider Status.**
Users can submit service requests only within the service provider's scheduled work hours as specified in their profile. Requests outside of these hours are not feasible. If the service provider activates the "disable account" feature to signal unavailability or leave, service requests cannot be made during this period. However, users are still able to send messages to the service provider.
